This comes as a huge victory for the gambling industry, which has been pushing for years to legalize fruit slot machines.</p>
<p>Justice Ginsburg justified her vote by citing the Constitution’s equal protection clause. “The fruit slot machine is a perfect example of how our laws can be applied equally to all members of society,” she said. “It doesn’t matter whether you’re rich or poor, young or old, black or white - everyone has an equal chance to win big on a fruit slot machine.”</p>
<p>Opponents of the fruit slot machine have argued that it is dangerous and addictive, but Justice Ginsburg dismissed those concerns. “Our courts have always been open to new technologies, and I have no doubt that the fruit slot machine will stand up to legal scrutiny,” she said.</p>
<p>The gambling industry is already celebrating the court’s decision. “This is a great victory for the American people,” said John Smith, CEO of Slots Inc. “Now they can finally enjoy some harmless fun playing fruit slot machines.”</p>
<h1 id="Roberts-Alito-Thomas-and-Gorsuch-Vote-Against-Fruits-and-Stars"><a href="#Roberts-Alito-Thomas-and-Gorsuch-Vote-Against-Fruits-and-Stars" class="headerlink" title="Roberts, Alito, Thomas and Gorsuch Vote Against Fruits and Stars"></a>Roberts, Alito, Thomas and Gorsuch Vote Against Fruits and Stars</h1><p>The United States Supreme Court’s conservative majority ruled 5-4 against a 71-year-old man who argued that his First Amendment rights were violated when he was banned from buying a watermelon at a Pennsylvania Walmart.</p>
<p>Justice Samuel Alito delivered the opinion of the court, joined by Chief Justice John Roberts and Justices Anthony Kennedy, Clarence Thomas, and Neil Gorsuch. Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg dissented, joined by Justices Stephen Breyer, Sonia Sotomayor, and Elena Kagan.</p>
<p>The case, Walker v. Walmart Stores Inc., centered on Walter Neil Walker Jr., who attempted to buy a watermelon at a Walmart in Philipsburg, Pennsylvania, in July 2013. Walmart employees banned Walker from buying the watermelon because they believed he might have been trying to steal it.</p>
<p>Walker sued Walmart for violating his First Amendment rights. The U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania ruled in favor of Walmart, and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit affirmed that ruling.</p>
<p>In their opinion, the Supreme Court’s conservatives rejected Walker’s argument that his First Amendment rights were violated. They wrote that “the plain meaning of [the First Amendment] does not include a right to purchase every product…from a particular merchant on terms that the purchaser finds acceptable.”</p>
<p>The court also ruled that “the fact that Wal-Mart sells other fruit products does not deprive its decision to ban watermelons of any reasonable support” and that “store employees could reasonably suspect that Walker intended to steal a watermelon given the generally high rate of shoplifting for this item.”</p>
<p>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg issued a dissenting opinion in which she argued that Walker’s First Amendment rights were violated and that he should have been allowed to buy the watermelon. She was joined by Justices Stephen Breyer, Sonia Sotomayor, and Elena Kagan.</p>
<h1 id="Justice-Breyer-Joins-the-Majority-in-Voting-for-Fruits-and-Stars"><a href="#Justice-Breyer-Joins-the-Majority-in-Voting-for-Fruits-and-Stars" class="headerlink" title="Justice Breyer Joins the Majority in Voting for Fruits and Stars"></a>Justice Breyer Joins the Majority in Voting for Fruits and Stars</h1><p>Justice Stephen Breyer, who is often considered the liberal counterpoint to conservative Justice Antonin Scalia on the U.S. Supreme Court, today joined the majority in voting that plaintiffs in a lawsuit against food manufacturer Dole could not pursue their case under a federal racketeering statute.</p>
<p>The lawsuit alleged that Dole and other food manufacturers had improperly labeled bananas, pineapples, and apples as “organic” despite the fact that they were grown with the use of pesticides and other chemicals. The plaintiffs sought to recover damages under the federal Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations (RICO) statute, which allows private parties to bring civil actions against organizations engaged in criminal activity.</p>
<p>In a 5-4 decision written by Justice Clarence Thomas, the Court held that the activities alleged in the lawsuit did not constitute a pattern of criminal activity sufficient to sustain a RICO claim. The majority rejected the argument that because some of Dole’s violations may have been intentional, all of them could be aggregated to form a pattern of criminal activity.</p>
<p>Joining Breyer in dissenting from this view were Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Sonia Sotomayor, and Elena Kagan. In her dissent, Ginsburg argued that “the ‘pattern’ requirement is met when defendants engage in two or more acts of racketeering within ten years.”</p>
<p>Breyer wrote separately to explain his vote. He agreed with the majority that “the use of pesticides does not always violate organic labeling law,” but he also said that he believed there was evidence in the record indicating that Dole had violated federal law in its labeling practices.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, he concurred with the majority opinion because he felt that it would be improper to allow a plaintiff to bring a RICO action based on allegations of corporate misconduct where state law provided an adequate remedy. “I do not think it right to allow federal courts to apply RICO whenever they deem state law inadequate,” Breyer wrote.</p>
<h1 id="Clarence-Thomas-Becomes-First-Supreme-Court-Justice-to-Vote-Against-All-Slot-Machines"><a href="#Clarence-Thomas-Becomes-First-Supreme-Court-Justice-to-Vote-Against-All-Slot-Machines" class="headerlink" title="Clarence Thomas Becomes First Supreme Court Justice to Vote Against All Slot Machines"></a>Clarence Thomas Becomes First Supreme Court Justice to Vote Against All Slot Machines</h1><p>Justice Clarence Thomas, who is often considered to be one of the most conservative members of the United States Supreme Court, became the first justice to vote against all slot machines.</p>
<p>In a decision announced on Monday, Justice Thomas voted against three different measures that would have legalized slot machines in Kentucky, Mississippi, and Ohio. In each case, Justice Thomas was the only dissenter.</p>
<p>Slot machines are seen as a particularly regressive form of gambling, and many observers were surprised that Thomas was the only dissenter in these cases. In a statement released after the decisions were announced, Thomas said that he believes that “the Constitution does not permit states to legalize this kind of gambling.”</p>
<p>Slot machines are extremely popular in many parts of the United States, and proponents of legalization argue that they can provide a valuable source of revenue for cash-strapped states. But opponents counter that legalization leads to increased rates of problem gambling, and can have a negative effect on communities.</p>
<p>This is not the first time that Justice Thomas has taken a controversial stand on gambling issues. In 2011, he argued in favor of overturning a federal ban on sports betting.</p>
<h1 id="Kennedy’s-Absence-Leaves-Room-for-Gambling-on-the-Supreme-Court"><a href="#Kennedy’s-Absence-Leaves-Room-for-Gambling-on-the-Supreme-Court" class="headerlink" title="Kennedy’s Absence Leaves Room for Gambling on the Supreme Court"></a>Kennedy’s Absence Leaves Room for Gambling on the Supreme Court</h1><p>In the wake of Justice Antonin Scalia’s death, many are wondering who will be nominated to fill his seat on the Supreme Court. The stakes are high, as the next appointment could tip the ideological balance of the court for years to come.</p>
<p>This is a critical time for gambling issues in America. One case currently pending before the court, which could be determined by Scalia’s successor, is whether states have the right to legalize and regulate sports betting. New Jersey has been battling in court for years to overturn a federal law that bans sports betting in most states.</p>
<p>The stakes are high for both sides in this case. For New Jersey, it is a question of states’ rights. The state argues that it should be allowed to regulate an activity that takes place within its borders. For the NFL and other leagues, however, there is a lot at stake. They argue that legalizing sports betting would harm the integrity of their games.</p>
<p>There is no telling how Kennedy’s absence might affect the outcome of this case. Kennedy has been seen as a swing vote in many cases, and he was often seen as sympathetic to New Jersey’s arguments. His replacement could tilt the balance one way or the other.</p>
<p>It is also unclear how long Kennedy will be away from the court. He has indicated that he plans to retire this year, but his health may keep him from returning soon. If he is not able to return at all, President Obama could nominate someone else to take his place.</p>
<p>Whoever is nominated will face a tough confirmation battle in Congress. Republicans have already said that they will refuse to consider anyone President Obama nominates, regardless of who it is. This could lead to a showdown between Congress and the president over who gets to appoint Scalia’s successor.</p>
<p>No matter what happens, there is sure to be some gambling going on in Washington over the next few months as we wait for Kennedy’s return or for Obama’s next nominee</p>
