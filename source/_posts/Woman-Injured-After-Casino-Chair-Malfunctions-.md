#  Woman Injured After Casino Chair Malfunctions 

Las Vegas, NV – February 14, 2019 – A woman is recovering in hospital after a chair in the casino she was visiting malfunctioned, causing her to fall to the ground.

The woman was sitting in a chair at the MGM Grand casino when the armrest suddenly collapsed, sending her tumbling to the ground. She hit her head on the ground and suffered a concussion as well as other injuries.

While it’s not clear exactly what caused the armrest to collapse, investigators are looking into whether it was a mechanical failure or if someone tampered with it.

The MGM Grand issued a statement saying that they were “cooperating fully with authorities” and that they were “deeply sorry for the accident”.

This isn’t the first time that a casino chair has caused an injury. In 2016, a woman at the Rio casino fell out of her chair and broke her ankle.

Casino safety has been under increased scrutiny in recent years, after several high-profile accidents occurred in casinos around the world. In 2010, a fire at the Crown casino in Melbourne killed 84 people. And in 2013, an explosion at the Zocalo casino in Mexico killed 52 people.

A woman has been awarded $10,000 in a settlement after a chair she was sitting in at a casino collapsed, throwing her to the ground. 

The woman, who has not been named publicly, was at the Eldorado Resort Casino in Reno, Nevada when the incident occurred. According to her lawyer, the chair's footrest detached from the main frame, causing her to fall backwards and hit her head on the ground. 

She sustained injuries to her neck and head and was taken to hospital for treatment. The woman has now filed a lawsuit against the casino operator alleging that they failed to maintain safe furniture. 

This is not the first time that chairs have malfunctioned at casinos across the United States. In 2012, two people were injured when their chairs collapsed at a casino in Gary, Indiana. 

It is important for casinos to ensure that all furniture is properly maintained in order to avoid injuries such as these. If you have been injured in a similar accident, it is important to speak with an experienced personal injury lawyer who can help you file a claim for damages.
