#  Virginia Lottery announces plans to offer sports betting starting in Fall 2018

RICHMOND, Va. (AP) — The Virginia Lottery announced plans on Tuesday to offer sports betting starting in the fall of 2018, becoming the latest state with legalized gambling to move into the growing industry.

The lottery said it will partner with international gaming company IGT to offer sports betting at its existing facilities across the state and via a mobile app. It expects to begin accepting bets in the fall, in time for the start of the NFL season.

Virginia is among a number of states where lawmakers have been moving to legalize or expand sports betting since a U.S. Supreme Court decision in May cleared the way for states to do so.

West Virginia became the first state to allow sports betting on June 1, followed by Nevada and Delaware. New Jersey, which won the court case that led to the ruling, is expect to start taking bets within days.

#  Virginia becomes first southern state to offer legal sports betting

Virginia is the first southern state to offer legal sports betting after the Supreme Court repealed the federal ban in May.

Governor Ralph Northam signed a bill into law that allows for up to five casinos in Virginia, each of which can offer sports betting.

“This commonwealth has always been a leader in gaming, and I’m proud our Commonwealth will be one of the first in the nation to offer legal sports betting,” Governor Northam said.

The Virginia legislature first passed a bill to legalize sports betting in February, but it was vetoed by Governor Northam. The new bill includes a number of consumer protections, such as limits on how much people can bet and bans on bets on college games taking place in the state.

Gaming companies are already gearing up to offer sports betting in Virginia. MGM Resorts International has announced plans to open a $50 million facility near Richmond, and Caesars Entertainment has pledged $10 million toward a facility in Norfolk.

Richmond, VA - October 2, 2018 - Richmonders can place bets on their favorite sports teams starting today! Philadelphia-based casino company SugarHouse announced that it will offer betting services at its new location in Richmond.

The SugarHouse Casino in Philadelphia was the first casino in Pennsylvania to offer sports betting after the Supreme Court struck down a federal law that barred most states from authorizing gambling on sports. The company has since expanded to other states, including New Jersey.

"We are excited to announce that starting today, Richmond residents can legally bet on their favorite sports teams at our new location," said SugarHouse Casino spokesperson Jaime Allaire. "We know many of our customers are passionate about betting on sports and we hope this new addition will provide them with a fun and exciting experience."

Allaire said that SugarHouse would offer a variety of bets on professional and college sports, including football,[카지노 사이트](https://choegocasino.com/) basketball, baseball, and hockey. He also said that the casino would be working with local business owners to create special promotions and events around major sporting events.

The announcement was welcomed by many local residents. "I'm really excited about this," said Richmond resident Tony Khan. "I love betting on sports and I have been waiting for something like this to come to Richmond."

Others were more cautious. "I'm not sure how I feel about this," said Richmond resident Kelly Martinez. "It feels like it's opening up Pandora's Box."

#  Legal Sports Betting comes to the Commonwealth of Virginia

The Commonwealth of Virginia is one of the latest states to legalize sports betting. The Virginia Racing Commission (VRC) voted unanimously on September 20th to authorize sports betting at the state’s five race tracks. 

This follows on the heels of the United States Supreme Court’s decision in May 2018 to overturn the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act (PASPA), a 1992 law that effectively barred states other than Nevada from legalizing sports betting. 

Since the Supreme Court’s ruling, a number of states have legalized sports betting, including Delaware, New Jersey, Mississippi, West Virginia, and Pennsylvania.

In Virginia, as in most other states, there will be a number of restrictions on who can place bets and how those bets can be placed. For example, only people over 21 will be able to bet, and bets will have to be made in person at a track rather than online or through a mobile app. 

Nevertheless, the move by the VRC is being seen as a big win for Virginia’s horse racing industry. As Kevin Cox, executive director of the Virginia Thoroughbred Horsemen’s Association put it, “This is a great day for Virginia horse racing and our fans. We are excited to add this new dimension to our sport and offer our customers another way to enjoy live racing.” 

While it is still too early to say how much revenue sports betting will generate for the state, it is clear that there is potential for significant growth. In New Jersey, where sports betting has been legal since June 2018, total wagers reached $385 million in just the first eight months of operation. 

So what does all this mean for Virginians? In short, it means that you can now legally bet on your favorite team or player – something that was previously restricted only to those in Nevada. So whether you’re cheering for the Redskins or hoping that Joe Flacco throws another pick-six this weekend, you can now do so with a little bit of added excitement – and hopefully some extra cash in your pocket as well.

#  Virginia residents can now legally bet on sporting events

Virginia residents now have the legal right to bet on sporting events, after a bill legalizing sports betting was passed by the state legislature and signed into law by Governor Ralph Northam. The new law allows for betting on professional and college sports, including football, basketball, baseball, and other sports.

The move is seen as a way to bring in new revenue for the state, as well as increase tourism. The Virginia Lottery will be responsible for regulating the sports betting industry in the state.

"This legislation will create jobs and generate new economic activity across the Commonwealth," said Governor Northam. "It will also allow Virginians to bet on their home teams with confidence that the games are being played fairly."

Opponents of the bill raised concerns about its potential impact on gambling addiction and problem gambling, but supporters argue that such problems are already present in states where sports betting is legal.

The new law will take effect on July 1st, 2019.
