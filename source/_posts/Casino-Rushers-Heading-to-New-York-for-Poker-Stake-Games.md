#  $10,000 Buy-In for Biggest Cash Game in Vegas History

The world’s biggest cash game is coming to Las Vegas. The $10,000 buy-in event is scheduled for the weekend of September 14th at the Aria Resort and Casino.

The current record for the largest cash game in history is $1 million. That mark was set in December 2017 at the Bellagio Resort and Casino in Las Vegas. The Aria Resort and Casino is looking to break that record with their upcoming $10,000 buy-in event.

In order to participate in the game, players must pony up a minimum of $10,000. There is no maximum buy-in, so those with deeper pockets could potentially spend millions of dollars on a single hand.

The game will be televised live on PokerGo, with hole cards shown to viewers worldwide. Poker pros such as Phil Ivey and Daniel Negreanu are already confirmed to participate in the event.

With such a large buy-in, it’s no surprise that there are only 24 seats available for would-be participants. Those lucky enough to gain entry will surely enjoy some of the biggest hands of their lives.

#  $1,000,000 Pot at Aria Resort and Casino in Las Vegas 

The Aria Resort and Casino in Las Vegas is now offering a $1,000,000 blackjack pot. The massive jackpot is open to anyone playing at the casino's blackjack tables, and the player who wins it will take home an incredible $1,000,000. 

The Aria Resort and Casino is one of the most popular casinos in Las Vegas, and this new promotion is sure to attract even more players. The casino has always been known for its generous rewards program, and the $1,000,000 pot is just the latest example. 

There are a number of different blackjack games available at the Aria Resort and Casino, so players have plenty of options when it comes to trying to win the big prize. In addition to the regular blackjack games, there are also several variants available, including double-deck and six-deck blackjack. 

Of course, players need to be aware that the odds of winning are not particularly good. The house edge in blackjack can be as high as 5%, so winning the $1,000,000 pot is definitely not easy. However, for those players who are lucky enough to hit that royal flush or blackjack hand, the payoff will be well worth it. 

If you're looking for a chance to win big money in Las Vegas, then be sure to check out the Aria Resort and Casino's new $1,000,000 blackjack pot. With so much money on the line, you never know – you might just be able to become a millionaire!

#  Atlantic City Casinos Court High Rollers for Stake Games 

Atlantic City casinos are seeing a resurgence in popularity, as they court high rollers for stake games.

The city’s casinos have seen a decline in business in recent years, as neighboring states have opened their own gambling establishments. In an effort to reverse the trend, casino operators are now focusing on high rollers – those who are willing to gamble large sums of money.

Stake games can be quite lucrative for casinos, as the stakes are typically much higher than at traditional table games. For example, at blackjack tables the maximum bet is usually $100, while stakes for poker can range from $5 to $1,000 or more.

High rollers often enjoy the thrill of betting large sums of money, and they can provide a significant boost to casino profits. In fact, some casinos rely on high rollers for as much as 50% of their total revenue.

To entice these VIP players, Atlantic City casinos are offering luxurious accommodations and top-notch service. They are also rolling out the red carpet with special events and exclusive perks.

Casino executives hope that by focusing on high rollers, they can revive Atlantic City’s gaming industry and bring back the crowds of yesteryear.
