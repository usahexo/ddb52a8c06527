#  Manchester United primed to edge out Milan in closely-fought baccarat Serie A clash 

Manchester United will be looking to make it three wins from three as they take on AC Milan in tonight's baccarat Serie A clash.

Both teams are unbeaten so far this season, with United having won two and drawn one, while Milan have won one and drawn two.

The Red Devils will be buoyed by their impressive 3-0 victory over Tottenham Hotspur last weekend, while Milan will be keen to bounce back from their 1-1 draw with Roma.

Baccarat is a difficult game to call, but United are likely to edge it thanks to their strong attacking force of Romelu Lukaku, Marcus Rashford and Anthony Martial.

Prediction: Manchester United 2-1 AC Milan

#  Arsenal ready to continue their good start to the season with victory over Roma in baccarat Serie A clash

Arsenal will be looking to continue their good start to the season when they take on Roma in a Serie A clash at the Stadio Olimpico on Wednesday night.

The Gunners come into the game in good form, having won their last two games against West Ham United and Everton, and they will be confident of getting another victory over Roma.

Roma, meanwhile, have had a mixed start to the new campaign and currently sit in ninth place in Serie A with six points from their first four games.

Arsenal will be without French international Alexandre Lacazette for the game due to injury, but they are still expected to win comfortably.

Here is what Arsenal head coach Unai Emery had to say ahead of the game:

#  Napoli and Inter look to continue their unbeaten starts against each other in an intriguing baccarat Serie A match-up 

Saturday’s Napoli-Inter matchup pits together two of the league’s unbeaten sides. Napoli sit joint top of Serie A with Juventus on 13 points, while Inter are lurking just behind them in third place with 11. The last time these sides met, back in March, Inter emerged as 2-1 victors, so Napoli will be desperate to extract revenge.

Both teams come into this game in good form; Napoli have only conceded two goals all season, while Inter’s new signings have settled in well and contributed six goals between them. Mauro Icardi is naturally the main threat for the Nerazzurri, but it will be interesting to see how Spalletti sets up to deal with Napoli’s attacking trio of Insigne, Callejon and Mertens.

All in all, this looks set to be a very entertaining match with both sides fancying their chances of coming out on top.

#  Juventus start as favourites against Genoa, but will they slip up in this baccarat Serie A match? 

After a shock 3-1 loss to Sampdoria, Juventus will be looking to rebound when they take on Genoa this Sunday. The match is being played at the Juventus Stadium in Turin, with kickoff scheduled for 10:00am EST. 

Bettors have Juve as the clear favourites. The odds of a home win are set at 1/4, while a draw is at 9/2 and an away victory for Genoa is at 14/1. 

Both teams come into this match in poor form. Juventus have only won one of their last four league games, while Genoa have lost three of their last four. 

Juventus are still top of the Serie A table though, with a four-point lead over second-place Napoli. They’re also unbeaten in their last 28 home games in all competitions. 

Genoa are eighth in the table, but they could move up to seventh with a win on Sunday. 

Juventus are likely to start with Paulo Dybala and Gonzalo Higuain up front, supported by Miralem Pjanic and Blaise Matuidi in midfield. In defence, Georgio Chiellini and Leonardo Bonucci are expected to start together once again. 

Genoa are likely to start with Diego Perotti and Krzysztof Piatek up front, supported by Milan Skriniar and Tomas Rincon in midfield. In defence, Sebastien De Maio and Nicola Murru are expected to start together once again. 

It should be an interesting matchup between two sides who really need a win. Juve should be too strong for Genoa, but don’t be surprised if the away side pulls off an upset victory.

#  Lazio hope to get back to winning ways when they take on Udinese in a baccarat Serie A match

After a disappointing 3-1 home loss to Napoli, Lazio will be hoping to get back to winning ways when they take on Udinese in their next Serie A fixture. The Biancocelesti had been in good form leading into that game, with just one defeat in their last six league outings, and they will be looking to put that poor performance behind them as they aim to finish in the top four this season.

Udinese are currently in mid-table but they have been inconsistent this season, winning just two of their last six games. They will be looking to cause an upset against Simone Inzaghi’s side on Sunday and secure all three points, but they will face a tough task as Lazio are unbeaten in their last seven meetings with the Zebrette.

Lazio come into this game fresh from their victory over Steaua Bucharest in the Europa League, and they will be looking to continue their good run of form in front of goal. Ciro Immobile has been in excellent form this season and he will be looking to add to his tally of 16 goals in all competitions. He is likely to be joined by Felipe Anderson and Luis Alberto in attack, with the pair having already scored 22 goals between them this season.

Udinese have injury concerns ahead of this game, with defender Silvan Widmer ruled out and midfielder Seko Fofana a doubt. The visitors do have some attacking threats of their own though, with Kevin Prince-Boateng and Cyril Thereau both capable of scoring goals.

Sunday’s clash between Lazio and Udinese is sure to be an exciting affair, with both sides having plenty of attacking talent at their disposal. It is likely to be a tight match, but Inzaghi’s side should have enough quality to come out on top and claim all three points.
