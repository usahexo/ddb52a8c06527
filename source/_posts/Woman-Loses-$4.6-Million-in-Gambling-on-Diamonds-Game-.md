#  Woman Loses $4.6 Million in Gambling on Diamonds Game 

In what could be the single largest gambling loss on record, a woman has reportedly lost $4.6 million while playing a diamond game in an attempt to win back money she had previously lost. 

The woman, who has not been identified, was said to be playing the game at the Ritz Casino in London last month when she lost the vast majority of her fortune. According to reports, the game is one where players can bet on whether or not a group of diamonds will be red or black. 

In this instance, the woman is said to have bet tens of thousands of pounds on black - and lost. This led her to gamble even more in an effort to recoup her losses, but with no success. In total, she is believed to have lost around £3.5 million (around $4.6 million). 

A spokesperson for the casino confirmed that the incident had taken place, but declined to offer any further comment. Gambling experts say that such losses are not unusual, but they are seldom reported due to the shame associated with them. 

"There's no question that big losses like this do occasionally happen," said one expert who asked not to be named. "But people almost never talk about them because there's a lot of shame attached." 

The woman's story is just one example of how easy it can be for people to lose large sums of money while gambling. In 2012, for instance, two casino players in Las Vegas reportedly lost $18 million between them in just two days . And in 2014, an Australian gambler took home nearly $23 million after winning a Sydney casino jackpot . 

While such high-stakes wins and losses are rare, they serve as a reminder that gambling can be a risky business - especially when played at casinos. With so much at stake, it's important for players to remember that lady luck can often turn against them when they're least expecting it

So if you’re thinking about giving it a go, be warned: it can be a very dangerous game indeed.
