#  Buffalo Bills to Start Online Sports Betting in Time for the NFL Season

The Buffalo Bills have announced that they will start online sports betting in time for the NFL season. The Bills partnered with MGM Resorts International to provide a legal and regulated online sports betting experience for their fans.

"This partnership provides our fans with a safe, legal, and regulated way to bet on NFL games this season," said Russ Brandon, president and CEO of the Buffalo Bills. "MGM is the worldwide leader in sports betting, and we are confident that their experience and expertise will provide a world-class betting experience for our fans."

MGM has been expanding its reach into the sports betting market. The company has partnerships with the NBA, NHL, and Major League Baseball. MGM also has a partnership with FanDuel to offer online fantasy sports betting.

"This is an important day for MGM Resorts as we expand our global footprint into one of the most exciting and growing markets in the world," said Jim Murren, chairman and CEO of MGM Resorts International. "The Bills are one of the most iconic brands in all of professional sports, so we are proud to be their exclusive gaming partner."

The Bills hope that this partnership will help them grow their fan base. The team has struggled in recent years, but they are hoping that this new partnership will help them turn things around.

#  Buffalo Bills Fans Can Place Bets on the Upcoming Season

The Buffalo Bills are a professional football team that competes in the National Football League (NFL). The Bills play their home games at New Era Field in Orchard Park, New York. The team’s official colors are royal blue, navy blue, red, and white. The Bills were founded in 1960 as an original member of the American Football League (AFL) and joined the NFL as part of the AFL-NFL merger in 1970.

The Bills have had a checkered history and have not reached the playoffs since 1999. There has been a great deal of change in the Buffalo Bills organization over the past few years. In January 2017, Terry Pegula became the owner of the Buffalo Bills after purchasing the team from Ralph Wilson Jr.

In March 2017, Sean McDermott was hired as the head coach of the Bills after spending six years as defensive coordinator for the Carolina Panthers. In April 2017, Brandon Beane was named general manager of the Buffalo Bills after previously serving as assistant general manager for the Carolina Panthers. These changes have led to renewed hope among Buffalo Bills fans that the team can return to its former glory.

Buffalo Bills fans now have another way to show their support for their favorite team. They can place bets on the upcoming season at one of Delaware’s three casinos. The state legalized sports betting on June 5th in anticipation of the Supreme Court’s decision on whether or not to legalize sports betting nationwide.

If you are a fan of the Buffalo Bills and would like to place a bet on their upcoming season, you can visit Dover Downs Hotel & Casino, Harrington Raceway & Casino, or Delaware Park Racetrack & Slots. Bets can be placed on both individual games and on how well the Buffalo Bills will fare during the entire season. You can also bet on which teams they will defeat or lose to during the season.

If you are looking for some good odds on your favorite team, you may want to consider placing a bet at Delaware Park Racetrack & Slots. The casino is offering odds of 350-1 on the Buffalo Bills winning Super Bowl LIII this year.

#  Buffalo Bills Players React to the News of Penn National's sports Betting Partnership

The Buffalo Bills are coming off a disappointing season where they finished 6-10 and missed the playoffs for the 17th consecutive year. However, there is some good news for the Bills as their partnership with Penn National's sports betting operation was announced.

Penn National is a major casino operator with locations in 22 states, so this gives the Bills a valuable partner as they look to enter the sports betting market. Players around the league have reacted to the news, with many of them expressing excitement at the possibility of being able to place legal bets on NFL games.

Bills cornerback Tre'Davious White had this to say: "It's great that we have this partnership in place. I know that I'll be spending a lot of time at the casino watching games and putting some money down."



Linebacker Lorenzo Alexander said: "I love it. This is something that I've been looking forward to for a long time. Being able to legally bet on NFL games is going to add an extra level of excitement to the games."



Defensive tackle Kyle Williams added: "I'm excited about it. I think it's going to be a lot of fun and I can't wait to get started."



Penn National's CEO, Timothy Wilton, had this to say about the new partnership: "We're excited about working with the Bills and we're looking forward to helping them grow their fan base in Western New York."

#  Penn National Partnership Gives the Buffalo Bills a New Way to Win

The Buffalo Bills are a team that has always been one of the better teams in the NFL, but for one reason or another, they have never been able to win the big game. That may all change this year, as the team has just announced a new partnership with Penn National Gaming.

Under the new partnership, Penn National will be the exclusive gaming partner of the Bills. This means that Penn National will have exclusive rights to operate casino games and sports betting at Ralph Wilson Stadium. In addition, the two organizations will work together to create a Bills-themed gaming lounge at Penn National's Parx Casino in Pennsylvania.

This is a huge deal for both organizations. For the Bills, it provides them with a new way to make money. The team already has one of the best fan bases in the NFL, and with this new partnership, they can now add gambling to their list of offerings. This will no doubt bring more fans through the gates on game days.

For Penn National, this is an even bigger deal. They get access to a massive new market with over 20 million people living within 75 miles of Ralph Wilson Stadium. They also get to associate their brand with one of the most iconic teams in NFL history. This is a great opportunity for them to build their brand and increase their market share.

It remains to be seen if this new partnership will help the Bills finally win that elusive Super Bowl championship, but it is certainly a step in the right direction.

#  The Buffalo Bills are Poised to Benefit from Penn National's Betting Partnership

The Buffalo Bills, who have not made the playoffs in eighteen years, may have just found the boost they need to turn their fortunes around. Penn National Gaming has agreed to a partnership with the Bills which will allow them to offer sports betting at their nineteen casinos and racetracks. This is a major win for the Bills, as it will provide them with a new source of revenue. It will also give them an edge over their rivals in the AFC East, as the New England Patriots and Miami Dolphins are not able to offer sports betting.

Penn National is one of the largest gambling companies in the United States, and they are no stranger to partnerships with NFL teams. They currently have partnerships with the Washington Redskins and Baltimore Ravens. The company is excited about this new partnership with the Bills, as CEO Timothy Wilmott believes that it will be a "game changer" for both parties.

The Bills are coming off of a disappointing season in which they finished 6-10. However, there is reason for optimism in Buffalo, as quarterback Josh Allen showed flashes of potential last year. With Allen returning along with some key additions on defense, the Bills could be poised for a breakout year in 2019.

Adding sports betting to their casinos and racetracks should help to bolster the Bills' bottom line. In addition to helping to generate new revenue, it will also create jobs and generate economic activity in Buffalo and its surrounding areas. Penn National estimates that their partnership with the Bills will create approximately 1,000 jobs across Upstate New York. This is great news for a region that has been struggling economically in recent years.

The addition of sports betting could also help to make the Bills more competitive on the field. There is no doubt that having access to this new source of revenue will help them to improve their team's salary cap situation. Additionally, this partnership could tempt some top players to sign with Buffalo, as they will now be able to bet on their own games.

It remains to be seen how successful this new partnership will be for both parties involved. However, there is no question that it has potential to be very beneficial for the Buffalo Bills. With Buffalo being one of the most starved markets in terms of professional sports success, anything that can help them break through and make the playoffs is welcome news indeed.
