#  Juventus continue their dominance with another title and unbeaten season!

This season saw Juventus crowned champions for the 8th consecutive time and for the 11th time in total. This is a huge achievement, but it was even more impressive given that they managed to do it unbeaten – an historic first for any Italian club.

There were some bumps in the road along the way, with some nervy moments in the Champions League against Tottenham Hotspur and Real Madrid, but overall Max Allegri’s side looked imperious. Cristiano Ronaldo played a big part in that, with his goals and assists crucial to their success.

His move from Madrid has proved to be a masterstroke by the Bianconeri, with his experience and winning mentality helping to take Juve to even greater heights. He already seems to have formed a lethal partnership with Gonzalo Higuain, who has also been in great form this season.

Looking ahead, there’s no reason why Juventus can’t continue their dominance and win more titles in the coming years. Ronaldo will only get better with age, while the likes of Paulo Dybala and Douglas Costa are also starting to come into their own.

It promises to be an exciting few years ahead for Juve fans!

<h2>Napoli put up a good fight but eventually succumb to the champions</h2>

Napoli were looking to cause an upset against defending champions Juventus on Sunday night but eventually succumbed to a 3-1 loss. The home side started brightly and took the lead early on through Dries Mertens, but goals from Paulo Dybala, Gonzalo Higuain and Alex Sandro gave the visitors all three points. Napoli pushed hard for an equaliser in the second half but could not find a way past Gianluigi Buffon in the Juventus goal.

The result means that Juventus remain four points clear of second-placed Napoli at the top of Serie A, with Roma five points behind in third place. Napoli have now lost their last two league games, while Juventus have won their last six in a row.

#  AS Roma have an impressive season and finish in 3rd place

AS Roma had an impressive season and finished in 3rd place, just behind Lazio and Juventus. This was an impressive result for a club that’s had to cope with Financial Fair Play restrictions in recent seasons.

Roma’s success this season can be attributed to many factors. The most obvious factor is the excellent coaching of Eusebio Di Francesco. He has tweaked Roma’s playing style and got the best out of his players. Another major factor has been the excellent performances of midfielders such as Francesco Totti, Miralem Pjanic and Radja Nainggolan. These players have been able to control games and provide crucial goals and assists.

AS Roma face a difficult task in next season’s Champions League, where they will have to compete against Europe’s top sides. However, they have shown in this season’s Champions League that they are capable of competing against the best teams in Europe. They reached the semi-finals, before losing to Liverpool.

#  AC Milan have a resurgence under Gattuso, qualifying for Europa League

AC Milan were in turmoil when Gennaro Gattuso took over as manager in November 2017. The club had failed to win any of their first eight league games under Vincenzo Montella, and they sat in tenth place in the Serie A table.

However, Gattuso was able to galvanize the team and lead them on a resurgence. They finished the season in sixth place, which was good enough to qualify for the Europa League.

Gattuso has continued his good work this season, and AC Milan currently sit in fourth place in the Serie A table. They have also reached the semi-finals of the Europa League, where they will face Arsenal.

This turnaround has been largely due to the signing of Krzysztof Piatek. The Polish striker has been in superb form since joining AC Milan from Genoa in January, scoring 13 goals in just 14 appearances.

AC Milan are now a force to be reckoned with once again and should be considered contenders for the Serie A title. Gattuso deserves a lot of credit for turning things around at the club, and he will hope to lead them to even more success in the future.

#  Lazio just miss out on Champions League qualification

Lazio have just missed out on Champions League qualification, after slumping to a 3-1 defeat to Inter Milan. The result means that Inter qualify for the Champions League, while Lazio will have to settle for Europa League football next season.

Lazio went into the game with high hopes of securing qualification, but they were quickly outclassed by Inter. Mauro Icardi opened the scoring in the 14th minute, before Ivan Perisic doubled Inter's lead in the 29th minute. Stefan de Vrij pulled one back for Lazio in the 73rd minute, but Marcelo Brozovic restored Inter's two-goal advantage in the 85th minute.

Lazio had chances to get back into the game, but they were unable to take them and paid the price. This was a bitter blow for Lazio, who had looked set to qualify for the Champions League for the first time since 2009.

Inter Milan were worthy winners on the night, and they now look forward to playing in Europe's top club competition next season. As for Lazio, they must now make do with Europa League football, which will be a big disappointment for them.
