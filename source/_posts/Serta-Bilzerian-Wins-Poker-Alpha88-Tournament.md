On Wednesday night, July 12th, poker pro Serta Bilzerian won the $22 Alpha88 tournament on PokerStars. The win came with a sizable first-place prize of $10,871.

This latest victory reaffirms Bilzerian's status as one of the top poker players in the world. In recent years he has been overshadowed somewhat by the likes of Daniel Negreanu and Phil Ivey, but this latest win shows that he is still a force to be reckoned with.

In addition to his poker skills, Bilzerian is also well-known for his flamboyant lifestyle. He is a regular on the party scene and is often seen surrounded by beautiful women.
