#  What is the population of Zambia?

The population of Zambia is about 16.5 million people.

#  What is the GDP of Zambia?

Zambia has a GDP of $24.7 billion as of 2017, according to World Bank data. This ranks it as the 123rd largest economy in the world.

Since its independence in 1964, Zambia has been one of the poorest countries in the world. The country’s economy is based largely on agriculture, with copper mining also being important. Zambia’s GDP per capita was just $1,700 in 2017, putting it among the poorest countries in the world.

Despite its low GDP, Zambia has made progress in recent years in tackling poverty and improving economic growth. In 2016, Zambia’s GDP growth was estimated at 3.3%, and the country is expected to grow by 4.3% in 2017. This progress has been helped by improvements in infrastructure and a better business environment.

The average person in Zambia still lives on just $2 per day, but there are signs that this is slowly improving. In 2015, around 47% of people in Zambia were living below the poverty line, compared to 54% in 2012.

#  What is the life expectancy in Zambia?

The life expectancy in Zambia is 58 years, according to the World Bank. This is significantly lower than the average life expectancy of around 78 years in other African countries. 

There are a number of reasons for this relatively low life expectancy. The most common causes of death in Zambia are malaria, HIV/AIDS, and tuberculosis. These diseases are all highly preventable and treatable, but access to medical care is often difficult in rural areas of Zambia. In addition, malnutrition is a significant problem in the country, leading to many deaths among children. 

Despite the challenges, there have been some improvements in the health sector in recent years. The number of people living with HIV/AIDS has decreased in recent years, and more people are now able to access treatment for the disease. There have also been efforts to improve access to clean water and sanitation, which will help reduce the incidence of diseases like malaria and diarrhoea. 

In order to improve the health of Zambians overall, more needs to be done to address the root causes of poor health. This includes improving access to quality healthcare, as well as providing adequate nutrition and clean water and sanitation facilities.

#  What is the literacy rate in Zambia? 

The literacy rate in Zambia is estimated to be around 59%. Although this number may seem low, it is an improvement from the estimated literacy rate of 38% in 2003. 

There are several factors that contribute to the low literacy rate in Zambia. One factor is that many people in Zambia do not have access to education. In addition, many people who are able to attend school do not have access to quality education. Additionally, many Zambians lack the necessary skills required to be literate. 

Despite the low literacy rate, there are several organizations and programs working to improve literacy rates in Zambia. For example, Pratham zambia is an organization that focuses on improving reading and writing skills for children in grades 1 through 5. Additionally, there are many government-sponsored programs aimed at improving literacy rates. 

Ultimately, there is still much work to be done when it comes to increasing literacy rates in Zambia. However, with continued effort from various organizations and programs, the literacy rate can continue to improve.
