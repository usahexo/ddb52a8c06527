#  How to Play Bingo on Zoom 138Bet

There are a few ways to play Zoom Bingo on 138Bet. 
One way is to join a bingo room and wait for the next game to start. 
When the game begins, the numbers will be called out and the first player to mark their card wins the game. 
Alternatively, players can join a bingo room that is in progress and mark off numbers as they are called. If there are no other players in the room, the computer will call out all of the numbers.
Players can also create their own bingo rooms and invite friends to join. This gives players more control over the games they want to play.

To begin playing Zoom Bingo on 138Bet, navigate to the Bingo tab and select Zoom Bingo from the list of available games. Alternatively, you can use the search bar at the top of the page to find Zoom Bingo quickly.

Once you have loaded the Zoom Bingo page, you will see a lobby with a list of available rooms on the left-hand side of the screen. You can click on a room to see more details about it, including how many players are currently in the room and what type of bingo is being played.

To join a room, click on the Join button and then select your preferred method of payment. After you have joined a room, you will see your cards displayed in the window below. The Lobby will also show how many players are currently in each room.
If there is an upcoming game that you want to participate in, you can click on Join Now and your card(s) will automatically be marked for that game. 
If there is already a game in progress and you would like to join, just click on Play Now and your cards will be activated for that game.
The numbers called during a game will be highlighted green on your cards. If any of your numbers are called, just mark them off as quickly as possible! The first person to mark all of their numbers off wins that round!
If you want to leave a game before it is finished, just click on Exit Game and your cards will be deactivated. Note that if you exit a game before it is finished, you may not receive a full refund depending on how far along into the game you were when you quit.
