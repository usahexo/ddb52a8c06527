#  5 Teams That Will Win In Week Eleven

1. The Rams will beat the Saints on Sunday. This game is in LA, so the Rams have the home field advantage. The Saints are coming off of a rough loss to the Falcons and may not be fully recovered by Sunday.

2. The Patriots will beat the Raiders on Sunday. The Patriots are always a strong team, and with Raiders quarterback Derek Carr out with an injury, they have a good chance of winning.

3. The Panthers will beat the Jets on Sunday. This game is in Carolina, so the Panthers have the home field advantage. The Jets have not been doing well this season, so the Panthers should have no trouble winning.

4. The Packers will beat the Bears on Sunday night. This game is in Green Bay, so the Packers have the home field advantage. The Bears are coming off of a big win against the Vikings last week, but they are still not as strong as the Packers.

5. The Cowboys will beat the Eagles on Sunday night. This game is in Dallas, so the Cowboys have the home field advantage. The Eagles are coming off of a loss to Seattle last week and are likely to lose again this week against Dallas

#  How To Bet On Week Eleven Football Games

This weekend is the penultimate week of the NFL regular season, and there are still playoff spots up for grabs in both the AFC and NFC. With just two games left to play, let’s take a look at how to bet on week eleven football games.

In the AFC, the race for the final wild card spot is heating up. The Baltimore Ravens currently hold the sixth and final playoff spot, but they are just one game ahead of the Buffalo Bills, Miami Dolphins and Tennessee Titans. The Bills and Dolphins play each other on Sunday, so one of those teams will be eliminated from playoff contention.

The Titans have a tough road ahead as they play the Green Bay Packers and Houston Texans in their next two games. The Ravens are facing off against the Detroit Lions and Cincinnati Bengals. If the Titans lose to the Packers and Bills beat the Dolphins, then Tennessee will be eliminated from playoff contention.

In the NFC, only five teams remain in contention for three playoff spots. The Philadelphia Eagles have already clinched a playoff spot, while the Minnesota Vikings have clinched the NFC North division title.

The Los Angeles Rams and New Orleans Saints are both one game ahead of the Carolina Panthers for first place in their respective divisions. The Seattle Seahawks are two games back of the Rams in second place in the NFC West division, while the Dallas Cowboys are two games back of the Saints in second place in the NFC South division.

The Panthers face off against the Jets this weekend, while the Rams take on Kansas City Chiefs. If Carolina wins and LA loses, then Carolina will clinch a playoff spot. If LA wins and Carolina loses, then LA will clinch first place in their division. If Seattle wins this weekend then they will move into second place in their division.

#  Best Bets For Week Eleven Of The 2016-2017 NFL Season

Welcome to the best bets for week eleven of the 2016-2017 NFL season. Each week, we'll take a look at three games that stand out above the rest and offer our predictions on who will come out on top.

The first matchup we'll take a look at is an NFC South clash between the Atlanta Falcons and Tampa Bay Buccaneers. The Falcons have been one of the best teams in the NFL this season, with quarterback Matt Ryan having a MVP-caliber year. The Buccaneers, on the other hand, have been struggling mightily and are coming off a humiliating 41-14 loss to the Arizona Cardinals. The Falcons should be able to take advantage of Tampa Bay's struggling defense and come away with a win.

Our next matchup is a battle of two AFC West rivals, the Oakland Raiders and Houston Texans. The Raiders come into this game as slight favorites, thanks in part to their high-powered offense led by Derek Carr and Amari Cooper. However, the Texans are no slouches either, with quarterback Brock Osweiler finally starting to play well after a rough start to the season. This one could go either way, but expect Oakland to narrowly come out on top.

Our final matchup of the week is an all-important battle for first place in the AFC East between the New England Patriots and Seattle Seahawks. The Patriots are coming off a dramatic victory over the San Francisco 49ers last week, while the Seahawks were able to rout the Buffalo Bills 37-18. Seattle is favored in this game by 2 points, but don't be surprised if New England pulls out another close win here.

So without further ado, here are our predictions for week eleven of the 2016-2017 NFL season:

Atlanta Falcons over Tampa Bay Buccaneers
Oakland Raiders over Houston Texans
New England Patriots over Seattle Seahawks
