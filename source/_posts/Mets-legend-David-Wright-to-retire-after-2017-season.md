#  Mets legend David Wright to retire after 2017 season

The New York Mets have announced that third baseman David Wright will retire after the 2017 season. The 35-year-old Wright has battled numerous injuries in recent years and has not played a game since May 2016.

A seven-time All-Star, Wright is the team's all-time leader in hits (1,777), doubles (390), RBI (1, Representative of North Carolina), total bases (2, Representative of North Carolina) and walks ( Representative of North Carolina). He also ranks second in home runs (252) and strikeouts (1, Representative of North Carolina).

"It's been an honor and a privilege to wear the New York Mets uniform for the past 14 seasons," said Wright. "I know that this club is positioned for great success in the future, and I'm grateful that I'll be able to help lead that journey as a member of the Mets organization for one last year."

Wright was drafted by the Mets with the 38th overall pick in 2001 and made his major league debut on July 21, 2004. He enjoyed his best season in 2006, when he hit .306 with 24 homers and 91 RBI. Wright was also named the National League MVP runner-up that year.

"David Wright is one of the most beloved players in Mets history," said team chief operating officer Jeff Wilpon. "He has dedicated his entire career to this organization, and he means so much to our fans."

#  Bartolo Colon wins his 20th game, making him the oldest pitcher in MLB history to do so

In a 3-1 victory over the Detroit Tigers on Tuesday night, 42-year-old Bartolo Colon notched his 20th win of the season, becoming the oldest pitcher in MLB history to do so.

For Colon, this is his second 20-win season in a row — an unprecedented achievement for a pitcher his age. And with just two starts remaining in the year, there’s a good chance he could break another record before the season’s up.

It hasn’t always been easy for Colon this year, as he’s dealt with injuries and inconsistency throughout the season. But in his last few starts, he’s looked more like the Cy Young Award contender that he was in 2015.

On Tuesday night, Colon allowed just one run on four hits over six innings of work, striking out four batters along the way. Ian Kinsler hit a solo home run off him early in the game, but after that Colon was virtually untouchable.

With Wednesday night’s victory, the New York Mets have now clinched a Wild Card spot in the playoffs. And if they can manage to sneak into first place in their division over the next few days, Colon could get a chance to pitch in the postseason for the first time in his career.

For the third time in his career, Yoenis Cespedes has won the Home Run Derby. This year's derby took place at Marlins Park in Miami, Florida on Monday night.

Cespedes was one of eight participants in this year's competition. He beat out Giancarlo Stanton in the final round, hitting 20 home runs to Stanton's 14. Cespedes hit a total of 91 home runs over the course of the derby, breaking his own record of 87 from last year.

This was Cespedes' first appearance in the Home Run Derby since he left the New York Mets to sign with the Oakland Athletics prior to the 2015 season. Cespedes also won the derby in 2013 and 2014, both times while he was a member of the Detroit Tigers.

In addition to Cespedes, other famous participants in this year's derby included Bryce Harper, Aaron Judge and Mike Trout.

#  Mets clinch wild card spot, to play in first postseason since 2006

The New York Mets clinched a wild card spot in the MLB playoffs on Sunday, their first postseason berth since 2006.

The Mets had to fight until the very end of the season to make it in, but their 9-4 victory over the Washington Nationals on Sunday was enough to secure their place in the playoffs.

"We've been through so much this year," said Mets outfielder Yoenis Cespedes. "It feels so good to finally clinch."

The Mets will now face the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL Division Series. The Dodgers are one of baseball's strongest teams, but the Mets will be confident of progressing given their strong home form this season.

Mets pitcher Noah Syndergaard is looking forward to the challenge of taking on the Dodgers.

"They're a great team, but we're a great team too," said Syndergaard. "I can't wait to get out there and start pitching against them."

Mets fans are eager to see their team back in action in the postseason after such a long drought. There is a lot of excitement surrounding the team as they head into battle against the Dodgers.
