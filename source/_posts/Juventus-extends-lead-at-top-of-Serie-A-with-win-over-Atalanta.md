#  Juventus extends lead at top of Serie A with win over Atalanta

In a match played at the Juventus Stadium in Turin, Juventus came away with a 3-1 win over Atalanta to extend their lead at the top of Serie A to four points. The defending champions were in control for most of the match and took the lead in the first half through a goal from Gonzalo Higuain.

Higuain then doubled Juventus’s lead midway through the second half with his second goal of the match, and Atalanta got one back through a header from Andreas Cornelius late on, but Juve saw the game out to secure all three points. The result means that they are now unbeaten in their last thirteen league games, and they will be looking to continue their good run as they travel to Roma in their next match.

Atalanta, meanwhile, remain in sixth place in the table after this defeat, and they will be looking to get back to winning ways when they host Udinese next weekend.

#  Inter Milan remains in second after win over Cagliari 

In a match-up between two sides fighting for Europa League spots, Inter Milan came away with three points against Cagliari. Mauro Icardi’s brace proved to be the difference-maker as Inter moved up to second in the Serie A table.

Icardi found the back of the net twice in the first half, and despite Cagliari pulling one back after the break, Inter held on for all three points. The result sees them leapfrog Roma into second place, though they remain seven points behind leaders Juventus.

Luciano Spalletti’s side were in control from the outset and took an early lead when Icardi finished off a well-worked move. They then doubled their advantage before halftime when Icardi again was on target, this time from the penalty spot.

Cagliari did pull one back after the break through Leonardo Pavoletti, but they were unable to find an equaliser as Inter saw out the win. With just eight games remaining, Inter will be looking to continue their good form as they aim to qualify for next season’s Europa League.

#  Napoli suffers shock home defeat to Parma 

Napoli suffered a surprise 3-2 home defeat to Parma on Sunday which left them 10 points behind Serie A leaders Juventus.

Gervinho, who joined Parma from Arsenal in the summer, opened the scoring after 18 minutes before Marek Hamsik equalized for Napoli seven minutes later.

Parma regained the lead through rapper Fabio Quagliarella in the 36th minute and then doubled it through Roberto Inglese moments before halftime.

Arkadiusz Milik pulled one back for Napoli after 63 minutes but they were unable to find an equalizer.

It was only Parma's second win of the season, following their 2-1 victory at AC Milan earlier this month, and left Napoli in fourth place, four points behind Inter Milan who occupy the final Champions League spot.

#  Lazio maintain unbeaten start to season with victory over Udinese 

Lazio continued their unbeaten start to the season with a 3-0 victory over Udinese. Sergej Milinkovic-Savic opened the scoring in the first half, with Felipe Anderson and Ciro Immobile both netting in the second.

The home side were dominant throughout and deserved their victory, although they could have scored more goals. Milinkovic-Savic was again impressive and he will be a key player for Lazio this season. They are now third in the table, just one point behind Juventus and Napoli.

Lazio have made an excellent start to the season and they will be hoping to qualify for the Champions League. Simone Inzaghi has done a great job at the club and he has got the best out of his players. They are a very young side but they are also very talented.

Udinese were poor in this game and they have now lost three of their four league matches. They are 13th in the table and they need to improve if they want to avoid relegation.


Lazio maintained their unbeaten start to the season on Saturday as they comfortably beat Udinese 3-0. Sergej Milinkovic-Savic gave them the lead early on before Felipe Anderson and Ciro Immobile both found the back of the net in the second half. The home side were thoroughly deserving winners on the day, with Milinkovic-Savic once again impressing. They now sit third in Serie A, just one point behind Juventus and Napoli. 
   Simone Inzaghi has done an excellent job at Lazio since taking over as manager in 2014 and he looks set to take them to even greater things this season. The Biancocelesti have a very young squad but they are also very talented and should be competing for trophies this year. Udinese meanwhile continue to struggle, having lost three of their four league games so far this season. They find themselves down in 13th place in Serie A and could be in danger of relegation if they don’t start picking up some points soon.

#  Roma make it six wins from six matches with victory over SPAL

Roma were made to work hard by SPAL but they still managed to record a 2-1 victory at the Stadio Paolo Mazza. Goals from Lorenzo Pellegrini and Javier Pastore were enough for the visitors, who have now won all six of their matches in Serie A this season.

SPAL had the better of the opening exchanges and came close to taking the lead on a number of occasions. Francesco Vicari saw a header bounce off the post, while Mirco Antenucci also went close with a powerful drive from outside the area.

Roma eventually took control of proceedings and took the lead in the 27th minute. Pellegrini got on the end of a cross from Aleksandar Kolarov and volleyed home from close range.

The Giallorossi doubled their lead four minutes before halftime thanks to Pastore’s first goal for the club. The Argentine latched onto Edin Dzeko’s knockdown and fired into the top corner from 20 yards out.

SPAL pulled one back in stoppage time through Andrea Petagna but it was too little, too late for the hosts, who remain rooted to the bottom of Serie A after six matches.
