#  Bavarian derby set to take place this weekend

This weekend, the traditional Bavarian derby will take place between FC Bayern Munich and TSV 1860 München. The two teams are separated by only eight miles, but there is a clear gulf in terms of quality between them.

FC Bayern have won the last fifteen meetings between the two teams, and are odds-on favourites to make it sixteen on Saturday. The Reds are currently top of the Bundesliga table, and will be looking to extend their lead at the top with a win over their local rivals.

TSV 1860, on the other hand, are struggling at the bottom of the table, and look set for relegation this season. They have only won one game all season, and are unlikely to cause an upset against FC Bayern on Saturday.

Nevertheless, the derby is always a hotly contested match, and there is sure to be plenty of passion on display at the Allianz Arena. Both sets of fans will be hoping for a victory in what is always one of the highlights of the German football calendar.

#  Odds makers have FC Bayern Munich as heavy favorites

The Champions League is back in action this week, with some of the best teams in Europe meeting in the group stage. The first game of the week will be FC Bayern Munich taking on Greek side Olympiakos. The Germans are considered heavy favorites by the odds makers, who have them at -275 to win the match.

This is not surprising given Bayern’s recent form. They are undefeated in their last 18 matches across all competitions and appear to be hitting their stride just as the important games start coming up. This is in stark contrast to Olympiakos, who have been struggling recently. They have only managed two wins in their last six matches and are coming into this game on a bit of a low note.

It is worth noting that while Bayern may be heavy favorites, they are not invincible. They did lose their last meeting against Olympiakos, albeit it was many years ago. Additionally, Olympiakos do have some dangerous players who could cause problems for the Bayern defense.

Overall, however, it would take a pretty big upset for Olympiakos to pull off a win here. betting tips For people looking to place a bet on this match, there is value to be had by betting on Bayern Munich to win outright.
